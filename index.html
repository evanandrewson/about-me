            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Evan was born along with his twin sister Sarah in Berkeley, CA and raised in Novato, CA. Most of his youth was spent swimming and playing water polo or playing Catan, hacky sack,
                or pinball with his buddies. After graduating high school in 2010 he attended UC Davis and received a bachelors in Food Science with a Brewing
                emphasis in 2014. He then immediately moved to Portland, OR where he began his adult life.

            <h3>Adult Life</h3>
            <p>Evan's first job out of college was at a coffee factory doing quality assurance. He pretty quickly moved on to do quality assurance at a milk plant
                before deciding the industry wasn't really for him. A backup plan of Evan's had always been to become a math teacher, so he began working as a tutor
                at Mathnasium while attending classes at PCC to begin a graduate program. He left to become a tutor for Kaplan but they didn't give him any hours. So
                he floated around for a bit before finally becoming a canvasser/fundraiser for various issue-based nonprofits. He spent a few years doing that before
                moving into sales and finally into a position as a mail carrier before he decided that he missed being intellectually engaged in his day to day life.
                So now he's attending a coding bootcamp to start the next chapter in his life!

            <h3>Hopes and dreams</h3>
            <p>Evan's immediate goal is to finish the bootcamp and land a job in tech, preferably for a company that makes a positive impact on the world. After working
                a few years in the industry, he hopes to complete a through hike of the Pacific Crest Trail. The ultimate goal is a steady career that allows him to
                one day own a house and go adventuring around the world.
